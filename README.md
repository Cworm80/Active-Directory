-In this project i will show you how to create a Active Directory this will allow you to manage users and groups in your organization.

First you will need to get a copy of 2019 Server, you can either buy it  or download on the Microsoft Website
I will be using a VM, you also need download Virtual Box and download the extension https://www.virtualbox.org/
Once installed you will login with your account that you created during the setup
